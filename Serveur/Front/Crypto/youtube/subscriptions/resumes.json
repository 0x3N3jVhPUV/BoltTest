International viewers are directed to crypto.iq.<br>* <strong>Verification is required:<strong> Australian law requires identity verification, similar to opening a bank account.

PayID is recommended for being instant and free.  Delays may occur on the first deposit. Be mindful of fees and limits for each method.<br>* <strong>Buying crypto:<strong>  You can buy fractions of cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional stock markets.  For example, you can buy $1 worth of Bitcoin even if a whole Bitcoin costs over $100,000. This makes crypto accessible to everyone. Use the \"Buy & Sell\" tab to purchase crypto. CoinSpot fees are 1% for instant buy/sell.<br>* <strong>Choosing a cryptocurrency:<strong>  There are thousands of cryptos available.  Research is crucial. The video demonstrates buying Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Pepe (PEPE).  Remember tickers (e.g., BTC, SOL, PEPE) are like stock symbols and help you find specific coins.<br>* <strong>Wallets:<strong>  Think of wallets like bank accounts for your crypto on the exchange. Check your balance, value, and recent price changes here.<br>* <strong>Selling crypto:<strong>  Use the \"Buy & Sell\" tab to sell. Be mindful of your emotions (fear and greed) when selling.  The video demonstrates selling $1 worth of Tron (TRX).<br>* <strong>Withdrawing profits:<strong> Withdraw Australian dollars (AUD) back to your bank account or PayPal. Withdrawals are generally fast.<br>* <strong>Tax implications:<strong> Crypto profits are taxable in Australia.
