Here's a summary:<br><br><strong>1. Getting Started:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Safety First:<strong> Use the provided link in the description to ensure you're on the legitimate CoinSpot website, not a fraudulent \"shadow site.\"<br>* <strong>Registration:<strong> Create an account with your email and password, and use the affiliate code for a small kickback for the creator.<br>* <strong>Verification:<strong> Verify your identity (similar to opening a bank account) by providing identification. This is a legal requirement in Australia.  You'll likely need to take a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with a code. Once verified, you can deposit up to $100,000 AUD per day.<br><br><strong>2. Depositing Funds (Fiat):<strong><br><br>* <strong>Fiat:<strong> This refers to traditional currencies like dollars, euros, etc.<br>* <strong>Deposit Options:<strong> CoinSpot offers several methods like PayID, direct deposit, PayPal, card deposit, BPAY, and cash deposit.  Each has different fees and limits.  PayID is recommended as it's instant and free.<br>* <strong>Delays:<strong> Your first deposit might be delayed by a day or two due to banking regulations.<br>* <strong>Deposit Amounts:<strong> You can deposit as little as a few cents, despite the high daily limit.<br><br><strong>3. Buying Crypto:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Buy/Sell Tab:<strong> Navigate to the \"Buy/Sell\" tab.<br>* <strong>Choosing a Cryptocurrency:<strong> CoinSpot lists over 200 cryptocurrencies (out of millions that exist).  Research is crucial to determine which coin to buy based on your risk tolerance, budget, and investment goals. Example: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE).<br>* <strong>Tickers:<strong> Each cryptocurrency has a ticker symbol (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin, ETH for Ethereum). Use the search bar to find coins by name or ticker.<br>* <strong>Buying Fractions:<strong> Unlike stocks, you can buy fractions of cryptocurrencies.  Example: You can buy $1 worth of Bitcoin even if a whole Bitcoin costs over $100,000.  You can buy as little as 1 cent's worth.<br>* <strong>Fees:<strong> CoinSpot charges a 1% fee for instant buy/sell transactions.<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Buying $1 worth of Bitcoin. Enter $1 in the buy field, review the transaction summary (including the fee), and confirm.<br><br><strong>4. Viewing Your Crypto (Wallets):<strong><br><br>* <strong>Wallets Tab:<strong> Check your \"Wallets\" tab to see your crypto holdings, their value, and 24-hour percentage change.  Each cryptocurrency has its own wallet.<br>* <strong>Balance, Price, Value:<strong> \"Balance\" is the amount of crypto you own. \"Price\" is the current market price. \"Value\" is your balance multiplied by the price.<br><br><strong>5. Selling Crypto:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Buy/Sell Tab:<strong>  Navigate back to the \"Buy/Sell\" tab.<br>* <strong>Selling Options:<strong> You can sell all of a specific cryptocurrency or a specific dollar amount.  Example: Selling $1 worth of Tron (TRX).<br>* <strong>Fees:<strong> CoinSpot charges a 1% fee for instant sell transactions.<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Selling $1 worth of Tron. Select Tron, enter $1 in the sell field (after switching to AUD), review the summary, and confirm.<br><br><strong>6. Withdrawing Funds:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Withdraw AUD:<strong> Click on your profile icon and select \"Withdraw AUD.\"<br>* <strong>Withdrawal Options:<strong> Withdraw to your bank account or PayPal.<br>* <strong>Withdrawal Speed:<strong> Withdrawals are typically very fast (seconds to minutes).<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Withdrawing $2 AUD. Enter $2, confirm your bank details, and confirm the withdrawal.<br><br><strong>Key Takeaways:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Research:<strong> Do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency.<br>* <strong>Risk:<strong> Crypto markets are volatile (prices fluctuate rapidly).  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.<br>* <strong>Taxes:<strong> Crypto profits are taxable. Consult with an accountant.<br>* <strong>Security:<strong>  Store the majority of your crypto in a \"cold wallet\" (offline storage) for enhanced security. This is covered in future videos.<br><br><br>This video offers a comprehensive starting point for using CoinSpot. Future videos will cover more advanced topics like using the \"Markets\" tab for lower fees and transferring crypto to cold storage.<br>"}
