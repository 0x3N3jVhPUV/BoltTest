Here's a summary:<br><br><strong>1. Getting Started:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Safety First:<strong> Use the provided link in the description to ensure you're on the legitimate CoinSpot website, not a fraudulent \"shadow site.\"<br>* <strong>Registration:<strong> Create an account with your email and password, and use the affiliate code for a small kickback for the creator.<br>* <strong>Verification:<strong> Verify your identity (similar to opening a bank account) by providing identification. This is a legal requirement in Australia.  You'll likely need to take a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with a code. Once verified, you can deposit up to $100,000 AUD per day.<br><br><strong>2. Depositing Funds (Fiat):<strong><br><br>* <strong>Fiat:<strong> This refers to traditional currencies like dollars, euros, etc.<br>* <strong>Deposit Options:<strong> CoinSpot offers several methods like PayID, direct deposit, PayPal, card deposit, BPAY, and cash deposit.  Each has different fees and limits.  PayID is recommended as it's instant and free.<br>* <strong>Delays:<strong> Your first deposit might be delayed by a day or two due to banking regulations.<br>* <strong>Deposit Amounts:<strong> You can deposit as little as a few cents, despite the high daily limit.<br><br><strong>3. Buying Crypto:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Buy/Sell Tab:<strong> Navigate to the \"Buy/Sell\" tab.<br>* <strong>Choosing a Cryptocurrency:<strong> CoinSpot lists over 200 cryptocurrencies (out of millions that exist).  Research is crucial to determine which coin to buy based on your risk tolerance, budget, and investment goals. Example: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE).<br>* <strong>Tickers:<strong> Each cryptocurrency has a ticker symbol (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin, ETH for Ethereum). Use the search bar to find coins by name or ticker.<br>* <strong>Buying Fractions:<strong> Unlike stocks, you can buy fractions of cryptocurrencies.  Example: You can buy $1 worth of Bitcoin even if a whole Bitcoin costs over $100,000.  You can buy as little as 1 cent's worth.<br>* <strong>Fees:<strong> CoinSpot charges a 1% fee for instant buy/sell transactions.<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Buying $1 worth of Bitcoin. Enter $1 in the buy field, review the transaction summary (including the fee), and confirm.<br><br><strong>4. Viewing Your Crypto (Wallets):<strong><br><br>* <strong>Wallets Tab:<strong> Check your \"Wallets\" tab to see your crypto holdings, their value, and 24-hour percentage change.  Each cryptocurrency has its own wallet.<br>* <strong>Balance, Price, Value:<strong> \"Balance\" is the amount of crypto you own. \"Price\" is the current market price. \"Value\" is your balance multiplied by the price.<br><br><strong>5. Selling Crypto:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Buy/Sell Tab:<strong>  Navigate back to the \"Buy/Sell\" tab.<br>* <strong>Selling Options:<strong> You can sell all of a specific cryptocurrency or a specific dollar amount.  Example: Selling $1 worth of Tron (TRX).<br>* <strong>Fees:<strong> CoinSpot charges a 1% fee for instant sell transactions.<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Selling $1 worth of Tron. Select Tron, enter $1 in the sell field (after switching to AUD), review the summary, and confirm.<br><br><strong>6. Withdrawing Funds:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Withdraw AUD:<strong> Click on your profile icon and select \"Withdraw AUD.\"<br>* <strong>Withdrawal Options:<strong> Withdraw to your bank account or PayPal.<br>* <strong>Withdrawal Speed:<strong> Withdrawals are typically very fast (seconds to minutes).<br>* <strong>Example Transaction:<strong> Withdrawing $2 AUD. Enter $2, confirm your bank details, and confirm the withdrawal.<br><br><strong>Key Takeaways:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Research:<strong> Do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency.<br>* <strong>Risk:<strong> Crypto markets are volatile (prices fluctuate rapidly).  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.<br>* <strong>Taxes:<strong> Crypto profits are taxable. Consult with an accountant.<br>* <strong>Security:<strong>  Store the majority of your crypto in a \"cold wallet\" (offline storage) for enhanced security. This is covered in future videos.<br><br><br>This video offers a comprehensive starting point for using CoinSpot. Future videos will cover more advanced topics like using the \"Markets\" tab for lower fees and transferring crypto to cold storage.<br>"}

He discusses his trajectory from computational neuroscience, where he believed biological insights could directly improve AI, to experimental neuroscience, and back to a renewed interest in neuroAI. He explains that early neuroscientists, particularly in vision research, underestimated the complexity of the brain, much like early AI researchers underestimated the difficulty of tasks like robotic manipulation.  He now believes that achieving true artificial intelligence requires understanding how biological brains work, particularly in how they coordinate multiple objectives (which he calls \"alignment\").<br><br>Zador expresses amazement at large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, admitting he initially doubted their potential. While impressed by their linguistic abilities, he emphasizes that language represents only a small fraction of human intelligence and that AI still struggles with tasks easily performed by animals, like physical interaction with the world.  He uses the example of self-driving cars, which still require frequent human intervention, and argues that even if they achieve lower error rates than humans, their mistakes need to be \"human-like\" for widespread adoption.<br><br>Zador discusses three key areas where neuroscience can inform AI:<br><br>1. <strong>Alignment:<strong>  Animals efficiently balance multiple competing objectives (e.g., hunger, safety, reproduction). AI struggles with this, often relying on brittle weighted sums of objectives. Studying biological mechanisms for coordinating objectives could lead to more robust and flexible AI systems.  He cites the example of ants sacrificing themselves for the colony, illustrating flexible prioritization of objectives.<br><br>2. <strong>Development:<strong> Zador argues for incorporating developmental principles into AI, citing the example of how animals adapt to different body sizes (Chihuahua vs. Great Dane).  He proposes a \"developmental curriculum\" for AI, where simpler sub-problems are learned sequentially, creating a foundation for more complex tasks. This could address the \"sim-to-real\" problem in robotics, where simulated agents fail to transfer to the real world. He suggests that a curriculum based on the evolutionary and developmental trajectory of biological organisms could be particularly effective.  He connects this to Max Bennett's \"Five Breakthroughs\" framework for understanding the evolution of intelligence.<br><br>3. <strong>Evolutionary Constraints:<strong>  The genome acts as a compressed representation of neural circuitry. Zador's work demonstrates that compressing weight matrices in artificial neural networks can improve generalization and transfer learning.  He believes studying the recursive rules of development and how evolution shapes these rules can inform the design of more efficient and robust AI systems.<br><br>Zador acknowledges that not all biological details are relevant for AI (e.g., ion channels).  He emphasizes the importance of abstracting principles, like translational invariance from receptive fields, rather than directly mimicking biological implementations.  He concludes by noting that while many current AI researchers see little relevance in neuroscience, he believes that novel insights from biology will be necessary for achieving truly general artificial intelligence. He also points out that \"delving\" is overused by ChatGPT.<br>"}

Dr. Marzouk Explains", "channel_name": "FinCrime Agent", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN3XPILtrrc", "duration": 1893, "publish_date": "20241111", "has_subtitles": true, "summary": "This podcast episode features Dr. Mariola Marzouk, a trade-based money laundering (TBML) expert, challenging the conventional understanding of TBML. Her main argument is that the term \"TBML\" itself is misleading and unhelpful.<br><br><strong>Key takeaways:<strong><br><br>* <strong>The term \"TBML\" is a relatively recent invention.<strong>  It emerged after 2006, driven by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Before that, illicit activities involving trade were simply categorized under different predicate crimes.<br>* <strong>The FATF definition is narrow and focuses on misrepresentation of price, quantity, or quality in international trade transactions.<strong> Dr. Marzouk argues this definition doesn't reflect the reality of how criminals exploit trade for illicit purposes.<br>* <strong>The narrow definition has led to \"defensive reporting.\"<strong>  Banks, pressured to comply with regulations, file suspicious activity reports based on broad red flags, even if they don't strongly suspect actual money laundering.  This leads to a flood of false positives, obscuring genuine criminal activity.<br>* <strong>There's a lack of research on how criminals actually use trade for illicit purposes.<strong> This lack of understanding hinders effective detection and prevention efforts.  Current methods are more likely to catch \"idiots\" than sophisticated criminals.<br>* <strong>Criminals don't think in terms of \"TBML.\"<strong> They simply seek to distance themselves from illicit proceeds.  They use a wide range of methods, often avoiding the specific patterns associated with the TBML definition (e.g., international trade finance, misrepresenting trade data).<br>* <strong>Technology is not a silver bullet.<strong>  While it can process information faster, it relies on flawed assumptions about how criminals operate.  Human intelligence and critical thinking remain essential for effective detection.<br>* <strong>The current regulatory regime is ineffective and unlikely to change significantly in the near future.<strong> Dr. Marzouk believes the focus on compliance and statistics overshadows the need for genuine understanding and collaboration to combat financial crime effectively.<br><br><strong>Concrete Examples:<strong><br><br>* <strong>The \"crispy clean\" meat trading documents:<strong> A compliance officer noticed that documents from a meat trader lacked the expected signs of wear and tear, leading to the discovery of a fraudulent transaction.<br>* <strong>The unusually tall shipping container:<strong>  Investigators found that a container used for shipping relatively low-value goods was unnecessarily tall and expensive, revealing an attempt to conceal illicit activity.<br>* <strong>The prevalence of \"de-risking\":<strong> Banks avoid doing business with certain countries or individuals based on broad criteria, rather than actual risk assessment.  This harms legitimate businesses and doesn't effectively target criminals.<br><br><br>Dr. Marzouk argues for a more nuanced and research-based approach to combating financial crime, moving away from the narrow focus on \"TBML\" and towards a broader understanding of how criminals exploit trade and other systems for illicit gain.  She suggests that real progress requires tackling underlying issues like tax evasion and focusing on the behavior of sophisticated criminals, rather than relying on outdated red flags and defensive reporting.<br>"}

Il souligne l'euphorie du marché, illustrée par un record historique du Bitcoin (ATH - All Time High) et d'importantes liquidations (642 millions de dollars en 24h), majoritairement des positions longues, signe que des traders particuliers prennent des décisions impulsives.<br><br><strong>Points clés et exemples:<strong><br><br>* <strong>Le marché est euphorique, mais ce n'est que le début:<strong>  L'intérêt pour le Bitcoin, mesuré via Google Trends, est en hausse, mais loin des niveaux du précédent bull run.  Il prédit une montée rapide vers 100 000$ avant Noël, puis potentiellement 150 000$ - 200 000$, avant une véritable \"alt season\". Exemple : l'intérêt pour \"Bitcoin\" sur Google était 10 fois plus important lors du pic précédent, signe qu'il y a encore de la marge.<br>* <strong>Attention à la \"Bitcoin dominance\" :<strong>  Actuellement, 60% de l'argent investi en cryptomonnaies est dans le Bitcoin. La véritable \"alt season\" (période où les altcoins explosent) se produira lorsque cet argent migrera vers les altcoins. Exemple: Solana, malgré sa forte hausse, n'est pas encore en plein boom. La vraie explosion viendra avec la migration des capitaux du Bitcoin.<br>* <strong>Gap CME et conseils de trading:<strong> Un \"gap\" est un trou dans le graphique du prix, dû à la fermeture du marché CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) le week-end.  Il existe un gap actuel à 77 000$, que le prix pourrait combler.  Ses conseils : 1) Ne pas shorter (parier sur la baisse). 2) Continuer à trader activement. 3) Respecter son money management (gestion des risques), utiliser des stop-loss (ordres de vente automatiques pour limiter les pertes) et éviter les positions longues sur les altcoins pour le moment. Exemple concret :  il a lui-même pris 50 000$ de profit sur un trade et attend patiemment une meilleure opportunité pour se repositionner.<br>* <strong>Importance des marchés traditionnels:<strong> La santé des marchés actions américains (S&P 500 et Nasdaq) est cruciale pour le Bitcoin. Il recommande de les surveiller. Exemple: le S&P 500 représente 51% de la capitalisation boursière mondiale, son influence est donc majeure.<br>* <strong>Analyse technique:<strong> Il observe des signaux positifs sur le Bitcoin et Ethereum, notamment via l'order book (liste des ordres d'achat et de vente), qui montrent un fort soutien et peu de résistance à la hausse.<br>* <strong>Promotion de son académie de trading et d'une plateforme d'échange:<strong> Il mentionne les activités de son académie, les performances de ses élèves, et fait la promotion d'une plateforme d'échange de cryptomonnaies (Zoomex) via un lien d'affiliation.<br><br><br><strong>Conclusion:<strong> Le marché est haussier, mais il faut rester prudent et discipliné.  Ne pas céder à la FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out - peur de rater le train), respecter son money management et se préparer à la véritable \"alt season\".<br>"}
